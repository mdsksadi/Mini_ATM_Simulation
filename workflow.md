# Our Workflow
1. Create a repo in gitHub    
    - folder = repository = repo = directory   
    - in git/gitHub repository are tow types:   
        - local repository   
        - remote repository 
2. Clone remote repo to local (clone = copy = Nokol)
    - Copy remote repo link. For now we will use HTTPS link   
	- Go to your local folder where you want to clone   
	- Open terminal by using cmd what I don't like. Better open "Git Bash"   
	- Go to targeted folder by using 
    ```bash
    $cd "<folder_path>"
    ````    
	- Clone remote repo by using:    
    ```bash
    $git clone <HTTPS url>
    ````
